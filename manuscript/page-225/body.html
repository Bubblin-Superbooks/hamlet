<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
HAMLET.
Very well, my lord.
Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.
KING.
I do not fear it. I have seen you both;
But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.
LAERTES.
This is too heavy. Let me see another.
HAMLET.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
[They prepare to play.]</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">OSRIC.
Ay, my good lord.
KING.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.
And you, the judges,</p></div> </div>
