REYNALDO.
Well, my lord.
POLONIUS.
Farewell.
[Exit Reynaldo.]</p><blockquote><p>Enter Ophelia. </p></blockquote><p>How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">OPHELIA.
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.
POLONIUS.

OPHELIA.
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,
No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d,
Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
POLONIUS.
Mad for thy love?
OPHELIA.
My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.
POLONIUS.
What said he?
OPHELIA.
