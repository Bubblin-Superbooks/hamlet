<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.
[Dies.]</p><p>HAMLET.
O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d:
Treachery! Seek it out.
[Laertes falls.]</p><p>LAERTES.
It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice
Hath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.
I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.
HAMLET.
The point envenom’d too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
[Stabs the King.]</p><p>OSRIC and LORDS.
Treason! treason!
KING.
O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.
HAMLET.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
[King dies.]</p></div> </div>
