POLONIUS.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him. I fearâ€™d he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!

To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
This must be known, which, being kept close, might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
