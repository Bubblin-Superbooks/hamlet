HAMLET.
Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.</p><p>ROSENCRANTZ.

Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p><p>HAMLET.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p><p>HAMLET.
