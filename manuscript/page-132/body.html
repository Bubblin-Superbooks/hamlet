My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
HAMLET.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
POLONIUS.
By the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
HAMLET.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
POLONIUS.
It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET.
Or like a whale.
POLONIUS.
Very like a whale.
HAMLET.
Then will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will come by and by.</p><p>POLONIUS.
I will say so.
[Exit.]</p><p>HAMLET.
By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.</p><p>[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]</p></div> </div>
