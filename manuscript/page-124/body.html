Madam, how like you this play?
QUEEN.
The lady protests too much, methinks.
HAMLET.
O, but she’ll keep her word.
KING.
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?
HAMLET.
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.</p><p>KING.
What do you call the play?
HAMLET.
The Mousetrap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall’d jade wince; our withers are unwrung.</p><blockquote><p>Enter Lucianus. </p></blockquote><p>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.</p></div> </div>
