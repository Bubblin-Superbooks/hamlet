<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:
  The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—
It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—
  The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
  Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
  When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
  Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d
  With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
  Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d
  With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
  Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,
  That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
  To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,
  And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,
  With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
  Old grandsire Priam seeks.
So, proceed you.</p><p>POLONIUS.
’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</p></div> </div>
