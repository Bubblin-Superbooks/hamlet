HORATIO.
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
HAMLET.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
HORATIO.
Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.
HAMLET.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
My father,—methinks I see my father.
HORATIO.
Where, my lord?
HAMLET.

HORATIO.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET.
He was a man, take him for all in all,

My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

HORATIO.
My lord, the King your father.
HAMLET.
The King my father!
HORATIO.
